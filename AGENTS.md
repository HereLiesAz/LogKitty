# Agent Instructions

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL AI AGENTS:**

Before committing ANY changes, you **MUST** strictly adhere to the following workflow. **NO EXCEPTIONS.**

1.  **Code Review:** You must request and receive a complete code review.
2.  **Verify Build & Tests:** You must run a full build and ensure all tests pass. Use `./gradlew build` or specific task like `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`.
3.  **Update Documentation:** You must update ALL relevant documentation to reflect your changes. This includes `TODO.md`, `file_descriptions.md`, and any other specific docs.
4.  **Update version:** Follow the versioning strategy below.
5.  **Commit:** Only AFTER steps 1-4 are successfully completed may you commit your changes.

## Versioning Strategy

* **Format:** `IDEaz-a.b.c.d.apk` (e.g., `IDEaz-1.0.0.14.apk`).
    * `a` (Prime): User controlled.
    * `b` (Minor): Incremented by Agents for **Major Features/Functions**.
    * `c` (Patch): Incremented by Agents for **Small Functions/Bug Fixes**.
    * `d` (Build): Incremented programmatically by CI.
* **Instruction:** When completing a task, you MUST update the `minor` or `patch` values in `version.properties` appropriately.

## Critical Known Issues / Discrepancies
*   **Zipline:** Zipline-based Hot Reload logic is currently **DISABLED** in `MainViewModel.kt` due to API deprecation issues, despite the build pipeline supporting code generation.
*   **Jules CLI:** The `JulesCliClient` is **DEPRECATED** and unused. All AI interactions use the `JulesApiClient` (HTTP).
*   **Tabs Order:** Documentation previously listed Project Screen tabs in incorrect order. The correct order is Setup, Load, Clone.

## Recent Changes (Summary)
*   **Documentation:** Updated `docs/` to match codebase reality (Clarified Host Architecture, Removed non-existent modules).
*   **Architecture:** Confirmed Hybrid Host (VirtualDisplay[Experimental]/WebView) as primary interaction model.
*   **Refactor:** `MainViewModel` split into 6 Delegates. `ProjectScreen` split into sub-tabs.
