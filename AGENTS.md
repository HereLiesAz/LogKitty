# Agent Instructions

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL AI AGENTS:**

1.  **Mandatory Reading:** You **MUST** read and understand all files in the `docs/` directory listed below before beginning any task. Ignorance of the project structure or rules is not an excuse.
2.  **Strict Verification:**
    *   **Passing Build:** You must ensure the project builds successfully (`./gradlew assembleDebug`) before committing.
    *   **Tests:** All tests must pass.
    *   **Regressions:** Regressions of any kind are **absolutely prohibited**. Committing broken code or regressions will result in **immediate termination**.
3.  **Code Review:** You must request a code review and address *all* feedback until the code is "spotless" before committing.
4.  **Documentation Updates:** You **MUST** update the relevant documentation files (e.g., `file_descriptions.md`, `TODO.md`, `manifest.md`) to reflect your changes *before* committing.
