# Code of Conduct for Agents

1.  **Read the Documentation:** You are required to read all files in `docs/` before starting work. Ignorance is not an excuse.
2.  **No Regressions:** Breaking existing functionality is strictly prohibited. Verify your changes.
3.  **Spotless Code:** Code must be clean, well-formatted, and free of lint errors.
4.  **Update Docs:** If you change code behavior, update the corresponding documentation immediately.
5.  **Verify First:** Do not assume a file exists or contains specific code. Read it first.
6.  **Test:** Run relevant tests before submitting. If tests are missing, write them.
